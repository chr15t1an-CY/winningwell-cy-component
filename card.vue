        <h1>Test.</h1>
        <h5>The "ctx" prop</h5>
        <p>The ctx prop in the sample script above is a JavaScript object that provides your custom code a bunch of context about the learner taking the lesson and their progress, as well information about the lesson itself. Also, we include some organizational information as well. </p>

        <p>Check it out! Want to see what the ctx property has stored in it right now?</p>
        <v-btn @click="ctxHidden = !ctxHidden" color="primary">
          <span v-if="ctxHidden">View ctx property values</span>
          <span v-else>Hide ctx values</span>
        </v-btn>
        <pre v-if="!ctxHidden">{{ctx}}</pre>

        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px">Example of ctx Property Use</h5>
        <p>Hi {{learner.first_name}}! Here's your progress so far!</p>
        <h1 class="animated lightSpeedIn">Score: {{ctx.lessonStats.points}}</h1>
        <h1 class="animated lightSpeedIn">Completion: {{ctx.lessonStats.completedPerc}}%</h1>

        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px">Completion</h5>
        <p>Custom code creators have the ability to block the advancement of a lesson by choosing when to "emit" the "completed" event. Under methods in this sample, you will see a "complete" method that "emits" the "completed" event to the parent lesson only when you click the complete button below.</p>
